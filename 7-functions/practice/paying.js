// Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here:

        // chord: a line segment within a circle that touches 2 points on the circle.
        // circumference: the distance around the circle.

        // origin: the center of the circle
        // pi (pi): A number, 3.141592..., equal to (the circumference) / (the diameter) of any circle.
        // radius: distance from center of circle to any point on it.
        // sector: is like a slice of pie (a circle wedge).
        // tangent of circle: a line perpendicular to the radius that touches ONLY one point on the circle.

// The Temperature Converter
