<h3> Why I like Rieslings</h3>
    <blockquote> I enjoy the variety of this wine. It's a good wine for beginners. In fact it was my stepping stone into wine drinking. <br> Initially I started out with whites, but they were not <br>
    palatable to this novice wine taster. My taste buds gravitated and found the sweet stuff way more fun.</br> <br> Eventually I did work my way up to the other wines. However, Riesling </br>
    remains my all type favorite.  It makes for a great relaxing wine that will not give you a headache if you are prone to those</br>

<h4> Price Point</h4>
    <p> The other reason why I like Rieslings so much is the price point.  It is a very reasonably priced product. Most decent bottles of Riesling  </br> 
        start at $9.99 and <i> under </i> Here's a link to one of my favorites <a href = "https://tinyurl.com/25d9sdzf"> Link </a> 
        <br> Some of my least favorites includes the popular <strong> RELAX</strong> brand. It taste like "pissy" juice </p> <br/>
    </p>

<h5> Pairings</h5>
    <pr> So I'm not all into cheeses like that. I googled this so take it for what it's worth:</pr>
        <q> Sweet Rieslings pair well with salty cheeses like gorgonzola, aged gouda, feta, or parmesan. 
            Semi-dry Rieslings work well with semi-hard, medium-aged cheeses. Try an asiago, Colby, fontina, monterey jack, swiss, muenster, Havarti, or different types of cheddar cheese.</q>
   
  <h6> Entertaining</h6>
    <pr> the next time you are entertaining or invited out would be a good time to introduce others to Riesling. </br/> 
         there's a good Riesling for every course! </br>
